        "    1. Keys: Must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",

        "    3. Storage: The key-value pair is stored at the computed index\n",
        "    4. Collisions: If two keys hash to the same index, Python resolves this with techniques like chaining (storing multiple pairs in a bucket).\n",
        "    5. Lookup: To retrieve a value, Python hashes the key, finds the index, and searches the bucket.\n",

        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?\n",
        "   - Tuples ensure data integrity in Python through their immutability, meaning their contents cannot be modified after creation. This property makes tuples an excellent choice for situations where you need to store data that should remain constant throughout the program's execution. Here‚Äôs how tuples ensure data integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Immutability :-\n",
        "     - Tuples are immutable, which means:\n",
        "    - You cannot change, add, or remove elements after the tuple is created.\n",
        "     - This immutability ensures that the data remains consistent and unaltered\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Hashability :-\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Tuples are hashable if they contain only immutable elements. This allows them to be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, ensuring data consistency in mappings.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Protection Against Accidental Changes :-\n",
        "     - Since tuples cannot be modified, they protect data from unintentional changes that might occur in mutable structures like lists. This is especially useful in large programs or when passing data between functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read-Only Nature :-\n",
        "     - Tuples are designed for read-only operations. Once created, they are used for accessing and representing data, rather than manipulating it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python ?\n",
        "   - A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an associative array format, enabling fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. It achieves this efficiency by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an underlying array, where the corresponding values are stored.\n",
        "   - In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, making them one of the most efficient and versatile data structures for key-value pair storage.\n",

        "\n",
        "   -\n",
        "Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. Unlike arrays in some other programming languages, Python lists are heterogeneous, meaning that a single list can store elements of various data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and even other lists or objects\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: A List with Mixed Data Types :-\n",
        "\n",

        "    - [1, 2] is another list (nested list),\n",
        "    - True is a boolean value.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Strings in Python are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be modified. This design choice offers several benefits in terms of efficiency, security, and simplicity in handling strings. Here‚Äôs why strings are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Efficiency and Performance :-\n",
        "      - Memory Optimization: Since strings are immutable, Python can optimize memory usage. When you create a new string, Python can share the same memory location for identical strings (interning) instead of duplicating them, thus saving memory.\n",
        "      - No Copying on Re-assignment: When you modify a string, Python doesn‚Äôt modify the existing string object but instead creates a new string object. This can help in maintaining a predictable and consistent state, as no string data is overwritten unintentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Hashing and Use as Dictionary Keys :-\n",
        "     - Hashable Objects: Python strings are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or as elements in sets. The hash value of a string depends on its content. If the string were mutable, its content could change, which would change its hash value, breaking the integrity of data structures like dictionaries or sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Security :-\n",
        "     - Data Integrity: By making strings immutable, Python ensures that string data remains consistent and secure throughout the program. Any accidental modification of a string is avoided. This is particularly useful when strings are passed around in the code since you don't have to worry about other parts of the program unintentionally altering the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. Predictable Behavior :-\n",
        "      -Avoiding Side Effects: Because strings are immutable, you don‚Äôt have to worry about unexpected side effects when working with them. If a function receives a string, it can be confident that the string will not be changed during the function's execution. This is crucial for functional programming principles and leads to fewer bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
        "   - Dictionaries and lists are both common data structures, but they serve different purposes and offer distinct advantages depending on the task. Here's why dictionaries might be preferred over lists in certain situations\n",
        "  -  Dictionaries are better than lists for tasks that require:\n",
        "      1. Key-Value Mapping: Easy association of meaningful keys with values\n",

        "     Why Use a Tuple? :-\n",
        "     1. Immutability: Coordinates should not change accidentally, ensuring data integrity. Using a tuple prevents modifications, making it a safer choice.\n",
        "     2. Semantic Meaning: A tuple clearly indicates that the data is fixed and grouped logically, like coordinates, whereas a list implies the potential for changes.\n",
        "     3. Performance: Tuples are more memory-efficient and faster than lists, which is beneficial when handling large datasets of fixed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n",
        "     - In Python, sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. When you add elements to a set, it only keeps unique values by checking for duplicates and discarding them. Here's how it works\n",
        "       1. Unique Elements: Sets do not allow duplicate values. If you attempt to add a duplicate, it is ignored.\n",

        "14. How does the ‚Äúin‚Äù keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n",
        "   - The in keyword is used to check membership, but it works differently for lists and dictionaries in Python due to the structure of these data types\n",
        "     1.  For Lists:\n",

        "1\n",
        ")\n",

        "  - When working with dictionaries, if you need to check for a value, you must explicitly use .values(). Similarly, to check for both keys and values, you can use .items().\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ?\n",
        "   - No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed, added to, or removed.\n",
        "   - Why Are Tuples Immutable?\n",
        "      1. Design Choice: The immutability of tuples provides certain guarantees about their state, making them reliable for use as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
